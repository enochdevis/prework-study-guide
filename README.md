# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The reason why I chose to make this study guide was that I wanted to get the necessary repetitions in to become an expert and get a solid foundation. Additionally, I didn't have an organized/easy-to-consume way of keeping my course notes in order, so building the study guide has been the solution for this. So far, I've learned that HTML is the foundational code, CSS gives us formatting and agreeable appearance, and JavaScript helps us with funcionality.

## Usage

What I love about this study guide is that it is sequential just as our coding should be. We start with HTML, then move on to CSS etc. So, studying it in this order is also recommended. It's easy to navigate in this way and also easy to edit if you'd like to add addtional data/info. If you open DevTools in the browser of your choice, you'll be able to see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
